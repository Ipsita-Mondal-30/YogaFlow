# Splash Video Setup Instructions

## 📹 **Video Integration Complete**

Your local `yoga.mp4` video is now integrated and will play when the app opens for the first time.

## ✨ **Features Implemented:**

### **Full Duration Playback:**
- Video plays its complete duration (no artificial time limits)
- Fallback timer set to 15 seconds for safety
- Natural video end detection

### **Blur Transition:**
- 1-second blur effect after video ends
- Smooth transition to main app
- Currently using gradient blur (white overlay)

### **Enhanced Experience:**
- Status bar hidden during video
- Full-screen immersive playback
- Proper video scaling and positioning

## 🔧 **Optional Enhancement:**

For a more professional blur effect, install expo-blur:

```bash
npx expo install expo-blur
```

Then uncomment this line in `SplashVideo.tsx`:
```typescript
// import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur'; // Uncomment when expo-blur is installed
```

And replace the gradient blur with:
```typescript
<BlurView intensity={80} style={styles.blurView} />
```

## 📱 **User Experience Flow:**

1. **App Opens** → Your `yoga.mp4` plays full duration
2. **Video Ends** → 500ms blur animation starts
3. **1 Second Pause** → White blur overlay visible
4. **Transition** → App continues to sign-in or home screen

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

- ✅ Local video integration
- ✅ Full duration playback
- ✅ Blur transition effect
- ✅ Smooth app continuation
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

The splash video experience is now complete and ready for production!
