# Splash Video Setup Instructions

## ðŸ“¹ **Video Integration Complete**

Your local `yoga.mp4` video is now integrated and will play when the app opens for the first time.

## âœ¨ **Features Implemented:**

### **Full Duration Playback:**
- Video plays its complete duration (no artificial time limits)
- Fallback timer set to 15 seconds for safety

## ðŸ”§ **Optional Enhancement:**

For a more professional blur effect, install expo-blur:

npx expo install expo-blur
```

Then uncomment this line in `SplashVideo.tsx`:
```typescript
// import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur'; // Uncomment when expo-blur is installed
```

And replace the gradient blur with:
```typescript
<BlurView intensity={80} style={styles.blurView} />
```
