# Authentication Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Stuck on Sign-In Page
**Problem**: After successful Google sign-in, users remained on the sign-in screen instead of being redirected to the main app.

**Root Cause**: The authentication flow wasn't properly checking for role selection completion.

**Fix**: 
- Updated `AppNavigator.tsx` to properly check user role status
- Added role selection screen as a required step after authentication
- Implemented proper user synchronization with Supabase

### 2. Missing Role Selection Screen
**Problem**: Users were automatically assigned as students without any role selection process.

**Solution**: 
- Created `RoleSelectionScreen.tsx` with two role options:
  - **Student**: Access to classes, community chat, asana library
  - **Teacher/Admin**: Can create classes, upload content, manage platform
- Integrated role selection into the navigation flow
- Added proper role persistence in both Supabase and AsyncStorage

### 3. Chat Button Not Working for Students
**Problem**: Students couldn't send messages in the community chat.

**Root Cause**: Users weren't properly synced with Supabase database, causing message sending to fail.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced `CommunityScreen.tsx` to handle user creation as fallback
- Improved error handling for message sending
- Added proper user validation before allowing chat access
- Ensured users are created in Supabase with proper role assignment

### 4. User Synchronization Issues
**Problem**: Inconsistent user data between Clerk authentication and Supabase database.

**Solution**:
- Updated `userSync.ts` service to handle role-based user creation
- Added proper error handling for user synchronization
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for user creation
- Added role validation and normalization

## New Authentication Flow

1. **User Signs In/Up** → Clerk handles authentication
2. **Role Check** → App checks if user has selected a role
3. **Role Selection** → If no role, user goes to role selection screen
4. **User Sync** → User data is synced with Supabase with selected role
5. **Main App** → User can access all features based on their role
