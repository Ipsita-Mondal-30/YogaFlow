# Security Remediation - GitGuardian Finding

## Issue
GitGuardian detected hardcoded secrets in commit `26af588` in the `.env` file, specifically Cloudinary API keys and other sensitive credentials.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed .env from Git Tracking
- Used `git rm --cached .env` to remove the file from version control while keeping it locally
- The .env file with actual secrets is now only stored locally and not in the repository

### 2. Updated .gitignore
- Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits of environment files
- This ensures that environment files with secrets will not be tracked by git

### 3. Updated .env.example
- Added missing Cloudinary environment variables to `.env.example`
- Provides a template for other developers without exposing actual secrets
- Variables added:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## Next Steps for Security

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Rotate all exposed secrets** - The following credentials should be regenerated:
   - Cloudinary API key and secret
   - Clerk secret key
   - Supabase keys (if sensitive)
   - Database credentials

2. **Update production environments** with new credentials

3. **Review access logs** for any unauthorized usage of the exposed credentials

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. Always use `.env.example` for sharing environment variable structure
2. Never commit actual `.env` files to version control
3. Use environment-specific configuration management for production
4. Consider using secret management services for production deployments
5. Enable GitGuardian or similar tools for continuous monitoring

## Files Modified
- `.gitignore` - Added `.env` to prevent future commits
- `.env.example` - Added Cloudinary variables
- `.env` - Removed from git tracking (file still exists locally)
